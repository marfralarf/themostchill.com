    <p>Hi, you can call me themostchill, or chill, or Mark if you want to get <i>really</i> familiar. I like game design, comics, and most other nerdy things. 
    <b>BIG SURPRISE!</b> I made this website as a space to put my many creative projects without having to worry about social media algorithms or any nonsense like that.</p>
